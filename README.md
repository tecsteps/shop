Your mission is to implement an entire shop system based on the specifications im specs/*. You must do in one go without stopping. You must use sub-agents! You must test everything via Pest (unit, and functional tests). You must also additional simulate user behaviour using the Playwright MPC and confirm that all acceptance criterias are met. If you find bugs, you must fix them. The result is a perfect shop system. All requirements are perfectly implemented. All acceptance criterias are met, tested and confirmed by you.

Continuously keep track of the progress in specs/progress.md Commit your progress after every relevant iteration with a meaningful message.

When implementation is fully done, then make a full review meeting and showcase all features (customer- and admin-side) to me. In case bugs appear, you must fix them all and restart the review meeting.
