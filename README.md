Your mission is to implement an entire shop system based on the specifications im specs/*.
Distribute work to sub-agents. Keep the context of the main agent clean.
You must do in one go without stopping.
You must use team mode!
You must test everything via Pest (unit, and functional tests).
You must also additional simulate user behaviour using the Playwright MPC and confirm that all acceptance criterias are met.
If you find bugs, you must fix them.
The result is a perfect shop system. All requirements are perfectly implemented. All acceptance criterias are met, tested and confirmed by you.

Continuously keep track of the progress in specs/progress.md
Commit your progress after every relevant iteration with a meaningful message.

When implementation is fully done, then make a full review meeting with Playwright in Chrome and showcase all features (customer- and admin-side) to me. In case bugs appear, you must fix them all and restart the review meeting. Shop is running at http://shop.test/.

Don't re-use any existing implementation in another branch. Build it from scratch.
